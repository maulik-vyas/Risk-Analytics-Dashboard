# Risk-Analytics-Dashboard
Credit Risk Dashboard in Power BI

📊 Project Overview

Developed a Risk Analytics Dashboard to analyze key risk metrics like PD, LGD, and EAD, Delinquency Rate, and Expected Loss, uncovering the key patterns to reduce the overall credit risk.

🛠️ Tools Used

* Microsoft Power BI
* DAX for calculated measures
* Power Query for data cleaning and transformation

🧠 Insights Discovered

* Average PD and Default Rate is the highest for Grade G and the least for Grade A as expected.
* PD and Interest Rate has the linear relationship so as the average interest rate increases, the probability of default also goes up.
* Over time, the Average Default Rate has gone down whereas Average PD slightly went up.
